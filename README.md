# getLattes

The objective of the application is to provide an interface that enables access to the functionalities of the getLattes package for those who do not have programming knowledge in R. This application is an integral part of a project developed in collaboration with Roney, one of the developers of the package.
The Lattes curriculum data can be downloaded in XML format, and the complexity of this reading process motivated the development of the getLattes package. This package imports information from XML files into a list in the R software and then tabulates the Lattes data so that it can be downloaded in .xlsx format.
