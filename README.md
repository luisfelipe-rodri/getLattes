# getLattes App

The application aims to simplify the access to the functionalities of the getLattes package for individuals without programming knowledge in R by providing a user-friendly interface. This application is an integral part of a project developed in collaboration with Roney, one of the developers of the package.
The Lattes curriculum can be downloaded in XML format from the institution's website, and the complexity of this reading process motivated the development of the getLattes package. This package imports information from XML files into a list in the R software and then tabulates the Lattes data so that it can be downloaded in .xlsx format.
